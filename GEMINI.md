# Pokete -- Grey Edition

![Example](assets/ss/ss01.png)

[See more example pics](assets/pics.md)

## What is it?

Pokete is a small terminal based game in the style of a very popular and old game by Gamefreak.

## Installation

```shell
pip install pokete
```

You can also install it from the AUR:

```shell
$ buildaur -S pokete-git
```

Or you can just run the AppImage from the release page.

NOTE: In that case you first have to create the `~/.cache/pokete/` folder.

For Windows:

Some windows antivirus may flag the `libplaysound.dll` as malicious. If pokete crashes, please make sure that the .dll
exists and is **not** in quarantine!

If you have problems with your ARCH you maybe need to rebuild the audio module, see [here](playsound/README.md).

## Running locally

```shell
pip install scrap_engine
git clone https://github.com/lxgr-linux/pokete.git
cd pokete/src
python -m pokete
```

## Usage

The game can be run normally without supplying any options.
For non gameplay related usage, use `--help`.
Try it out [online](https://replit.com/@lxgr-linux/pokete).

## How to play

Imagine that you're a Pokete Trainer and you travel around the world to catch/train as many Poketes as possible with the
ultimate goal of becoming the best trainer.

First of all you get a starter Pokete (Steini), that you can use to fight battles with other Poketes.
Use W, A, S and D to move around.

When entering the high grass (;), you may be attacked by a wild Pokete. By pressing `1` you can choose between the
attacks your Pokete has (as long their AP is over 0). By pressing the according number, or navigating with the `*`
cursor to the attack and pressing `Enter` you can use the attack selected. The wild Pokete will fight back, but you can
kill it and gain XP to level up your Pokete. If you would like to catch a wild Pokete, you must first weaken it and then
throw a Poketeball. With a bit of luck, you can catch it and have it fight for you.

By pressing the `1` key, you can take a look at your current deck. You can see detailed information of your Pokete and
your attacks, or rearrange them.
Changes will only be saved by quitting the game using the exit function.

Since you're a Pokete Trainer, you can also fight against other trainers (they appear as an 'a'). He will start a fight
with you when you get close enough to him. You can not run from a trainer fight; you either have to win, or lose. These
trainer fights give double the XP.

When one of your Poketes is too weak or dies, you can heal it by going into the Pokete Center (the house), talk the the
person there and choose the healing option.
Here you can also take a look at all of your Poketes, and not just the six in your team. The ones marked with an `o` are
the ones in your deck.

By pressing `e`, a menu will appear where player name, and later other settings, can be changed.

The red balls all over the map are Poketeballs. You'll need these to catch Poketes. Stepping on such a ball will add it
to your inventory.

See [How to play](docs/HowToPlay.md).

## Game depth

Not only are there Poketes that are stronger than others, but also Poketes with different types, which are effective
against some types and ineffective against others.

| Type    | Effective against            | Ineffective against |
|---------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| Normal  |                              |                     |
| Stone   | Flying, Fire                 | Plant               |
| Plant   | Stone, Ground, Water         | Fire, Ice           |
| Water   | Stone, Flying, Fire          | Plant, Ice          |
| Fire    | Flying, Plant, Undead, Ice   | Stone, Water        |
| Ground  | Normal                       | Flying              |
| Electro | Stone, Flying                | Ground              |
| Flying  | Plant                        | Stone               |
| Undead  | Normal, Ground, Plant, Water | Fire                |
| Ice     | Water, Plant                 | Fire                |

# Development guide for Pokete

This guide only handles adding new types, attacks and Poketes to Pokete. For further information on class and function
syntax, see the HTML documentation or `$ pydoc <file>`.

2. [Adding attacks](#adding-attacks)
3. [Adding types](#adding-types)
4. [Adding subtypes](#adding-subtypes)
5. [Adding maps](#adding-maps)

## Adding Poketes

Every Pokete has an entry in the `pokes` dictionary in [`pokete_data/poketes.py`](./pokete_data/poketes.py). Every entry
needs to have this structure:

```Python
"steini": {
  # This is the Poketes simplified name/identifier without spaces and in lowercase, which is used to refer to the Pokete in the code
  "name": "Steini",  # This is the Pokete's pretty name
  "hp": 25,  # The Pokete's max health points
  "atc": 2,  # The Pokete's attack points that will added to the Pokete's level
  "defense": 4,  # The Pokete's defense points that will added to the Pokete's level
  "attacks": ["tackle", "politure", "brick_throw"],  # The Pokete's starting attacks
  "pool": [],  # List of additional ungeneric attacks the Pokete can learn
  "miss_chance": 0,  # The chance a Pokete will miss an attack, this is added to the attacks individual `miss_chance`
  "desc": "A squared stone that can casually be found on the ground.",  # The Pokete's description
  "lose_xp": 3,  # The amount of experience the player gets by killing the Pokete
  "rarity": 1,  # Rarity
  "types": ["stone", "normal"],  # The Pokete's types
  "evolve_poke": "",  # The name/identifier of the Pokete, that this Pokete evolves to at a certain level
  "evolve_lvl": 0,  # The level the Pokete evolves at
  "initiative": 5,
  # The Pokete's initiative points that will added to the Pokete's level, and determine what Pokete starts in a fight
  "ico": [{
    # A list of dictionaries containing a displayed string and a color; all those strings will be layered over each other and represent the Pokete in the fight
    "txt": """ +-------+
 | o   o |
 |  www  |
 +-------+ """,
    "esc": None}],
},
```

For more examples on the dictionaries see [`pokete_data/poketes.py`](./pokete_data/poketes.py).

### Types

Only the first type in the `"types"` list is the Poketes actual displayed type that determines the Pokete's effectivity.
The other types in the list are just secondary types that determine what generic attacks a Pokete is able to learn.
Those can also be subtypes. The main type can't!
For a list of all types and subtypes see [`pokete_data/types.py`](./pokete_data/types.py)

### Learning attacks

In addition the attacks in the `"attacks"` and the `"pool"` lists, a Pokete can learn all generic attacks of the Poketes
types.

## Adding attacks

Every attack has an entry in the `attacks` dictionary in [`pokete_data/attacks.py `](./pokete_data/attacks.py). Every
entry needs to have this structure:

```Python
"poison_bite": {
  # This is the attack's simplified name/identifier without spaces and in lowercase, which is used to refer to the attack in the code
  "name": "Poison bite",  # The attack's pretty name
  "factor": 1,  # The attack factor that is used to calculate damage
  "action": "",
  # A string that's executed when the attack is used, to effect the Pokete's or the enemy's values (don't use this)
  "world_action": "",  # An extra ability the attack can be used for
  "move": ["attack", "downgrade"],  # The moves the Pokete does using the attack
  "miss_chance": 0.3,  # The chance to miss the attack
  "min_lvl": 0,  # The minimal level a Pokete needs in order to learn the attack
  "desc": "Makes the enemy weaker.",  # The attack's description
  "types": ["poison"],  # The attack's types
  "effect": "poison",  # The effect the enemy gets when the attack is used, default is None
  "is_generic": False,  # Whether or not the attack can be learned by any Pokete of its types
  "ap": 10,  # Attack points; the amount of times the attack can be used by a Pokete until the Pokete has to be healed
},
```

For more examples on the dictionaries see [`pokete_data/attacks.py`](./pokete_data/attacks.py).

### Types and learning

Only the first type in the `"types"` list is the attack's real type and determines its effectivity. The other type can
only be subtypes. A generic attack can only be learned by a Pokete that has all its types. An ungeneric attack can only
be learned if the attack is in the Pokete's `"pool"` or `"attacks"` list.

### Effects

The effect given in the `"effect"` attribute has to be the `c_name` of an effect listed
in [`pokete_classes/types.py`](./pokete_classes/types.py ) or `None`.

### World action

An attacks `"world_action"` is some kind of extra ability which can be called from the Poketes detail view and be used
to, for example, make the player fly. The string in `"world_action"` has to be a key in the `abb_funcs` list
in [`pokete.py`](./pokete.py).

## Adding types

Every type has an entry inside the `types` dictionary in [`pokete_data/types.py`](./pokete_data/types.py). Every entry
needs to have this structure:

```Python
"stone": {  # The type's name
  "effective": ["flying", "fire"],  # The types the type is effective against
  "ineffective": ["plant"],  # The types the type is ineffective against
  "color": ["grey"]  # The type's label color
},
```

## Adding subtypes

Every subtype has an entry inside the `sub_types` list in [`pokete_data/types.py`](./pokete_data/types.py). They have no
further attributes. Subtypes are only useful to determine what Poketes can use what generic attack in a type. For
example, to avoid that `bato` learns the generic `flying` attack `pick`.

## Adding maps

Every map has an entry in the `maps` list in `pokete_data/maps.py`. Every map needs to have this structure:

```Python
"intromap": {
  "height": 15,
  "width": 30,
  "song": "03 Chibi Ninja.mp3",
  "pretty_name": "Your home",
  "extra_actions": None,
  "poke_args": None,
  "weather": None
},
```

When creating maps you can use any of the provided map data which is found in `pokete_data/map_data.py`. You will have
to create your map data and name it the same name as your map. Your map data should be created in this format:

```Python
     "playmap_1": {
  "hard_obs": {
  },
  "soft_obs": {
  },
  "dors": {
  },
  "balls": {
  }
},
```

There are given buildings you can add such as:

```Python
CENTER = r""" __________
 /         /\
/_Center!_/  \
| # ___ # |  |
|___| |___|__|"""

SHOP = r"""   __________
 /         /\
/__Shop!__/  \
| # ___ # |  |
|___| |___|__|"""

HOUSE1 = r""" ________
 /       /\
/_______/  \
|# ___ #|  |
|__| |__|__|"""
```

You would add them by adding this to the map:

```Python
"pokecenter": {
  "x": 20,
  "y": 0,
  "txt": CENTER
},
"house1": {
  "x": 2,
  "y": 0,
  "txt": HOUSE1
},
"shop": {
  "x": 29,
  "y": 3,
  "txt": SHOP
},
```

You can also add you own buildings if you want like this:

```Python
"hotel": {
  "x": 43,
  "y": 18,
  "txt": r"""    ..___________
  /||          /\
 / ||         /  \
/___Hotel!___/    \
| ##      ## | ## |
|    ____    |    |
|____|  |____|____|"""
},
```

You should also add terrain such as:

```Python
"hard_obs": {
  "tree_group_1": {
    "x": 35,
    "y": 2,
    "txt": """ (()(()((())((()((()
())(())))())))()))(()
 || ||| ||||| |||||"""
  },
}
```

You can also add soft obstacles where you can find poketes such as:

```Python
"soft_obs": {
  "meadow1": {
    "x": 1,
    "y": 8,
    "txt": """     ;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
   ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
     ;;;;;;"""
  },
}
```

If you want to add a door to a building you do that with the `dors:` portion of the dict such as:

```Python
"dors": {
  "dor_playmap_51_1": {
    "x": 90,
    "y": 12,
    "args": {"map": "playmap_51", "x": 1, "y": 28}
  },
}
```

If you're adding doors to buildings you should also include a map of the inside of the building such as:

```Python
"playmap_22": {
  "hard_obs": {
    "inner_walls": {
      "x": 2,
      "y": 1,
      "txt": """________________________
|______________________|
|          a           |
|       ________       |
|                      |
|                      | |
|                        |
|                      __|
|__________  __________|
|_________|  |_________|"""
    },
  },
}
```

To add balls to pickup throughout the map you add them like this:

```Python
"balls": {
  "ball_1": {
    "x": 1,
    "y": 1
  },
  "ball_2": {
    "x": 7,
    "y": 12
  },
}
```

Also new maps have to be added to `pokete_data/mapstations.py` to be displayed correctly in the minimap.

## Plot
The plot of the game is that you - a ten year old boy/girl - are running around in the world doing what ten year olds do: catching little creatures (Poketes) and letting them fight against other little creatures.

You are on a journey to explore the world and catch all Poketes. Along the way you will meet many different NPCs that may or may not be nice to you.

## Controls
After first starting the game you can move the character, the one little `a` on the screen, using `w`, `a`, `s` and `d`.

![Map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss08.png)

You can open the settings/menu by pressing `e`.

![Menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss07.png)

In this type of menu you can navigate using `w` and `s` to move the cursor and `Enter` to select the option. To exit just press `Esc` or `q`.

## Fights

When going onto the green grass patch you may get attacked by a wild Pokete.

![Grass](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss09.png)

![Grass](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss10.png)

Now you have several options to choose from; you can attack and weaken the Pokete to catch it, run away, or choose another Pokete.

To attack, just press `1` and a little selection window opens where you can choose from your attacks. You can either navigate the cursor to the attack you want to choose (using `w` and `s`) and then press `Enter`, or you can just type in the number before the attack name.

The Number behind the name are the AP (Attack Points) of the attack (The number of times you can use the attack and the number of uses you have remaining).

![Attacking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss11.png)

When you fight until the enemy Pokete's HP is low (like 1 to 3 HP), you can try to catch it. By pressing `3` you can open your inventory where you can choose from the items you have. By pressing `enter` you can use your chosen item. In the case of trying to catch the opposing Pokete, you should select the Poketeball.

![Catching](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss12.png)

Catching a Pokete may not be successful at first.
You can also kill the Pokete and gain XP for your Pokete.

## Trainers
Trainers are other ten year old Pokete trainers just like you. They are the other `a`s you may encounter on the map. They will talk to you and then start a fight. The only difference between a trainer fight and a normal fight is that you cannot run away from a trainer fight and cannot catch the enemy's Pokete. They will give you $20 if you win.

## Inventory
By pressing `4`, you can open your inventory. This is where you can see all of your items, and how much money you have. By selecting an item with the cursor and pressing `Enter` you can see the item's description. To exit, just press `Esc` or `q`.

![Inv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss18.png)

By having an item selected and pressing `r`, you can remove it from your inventory.

## Minimap
By pressing `3`, you can open a map of the Pokete world where you can see and select all Routes and Towns on the map. You can select and navigate by using `w`, `a`, `s` and `d`. To exit, just press `Esc` or `q`.

![Map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss19.png)

## Pokete Centers
On your journey through the Pokete world you may discover some houses.

Some of these houses are Pokete Centers where you can heal your wounded Poketes and reorganize your deck.

![Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss13.png)

By going up to the person behind the counter you can interact with them.

![Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss14.png)

## Pokete shops
In some towns there are also shops present where you can by items like Potions and Poketeballs.

![Shop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss15.png)

By going up to the person behind the counter you can interact with them.

![Shop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss16.png)

To buy an item, just navigate the cursor to it and press `Enter`. The item will then be added to your inventory. To exit, just press `Esc` or `q`.

## Poketeballs
Poketeballs are needed to catch Poketes. You can see how many Poketeballs you have in your inventory, buy them from the [Pokete Shop](#pokete-shops) and find them on the map.
They are the small red balls hidden all over the map, and can be collected by just walking over them.

![Balls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss17.png)

## Settings
In the game's settings you can change the player's name, save your game, exit, or change other settings. To exit, just press `Esc` or `q`.

![Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss20.png)

## Trading
When you're in the same network as another Pokete player you can trade one of your Poketes for one of theirs.
In the Pokete Center stands another NPC, the trader, who you can talk to and start a trade.

![trading](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss21.png)

One of the two players must be the host, while the other is the guest. The host has to start the trade first for it to work.

![trading](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss22.png)

When prompted, the guest must type in the hostname of the host's computer displayed on the host's display.
You may run into problems with firewalls.

![trading](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss23.png)

## Shiny Poketes
Shiny Poketes are rare to find (chance 1/500) and have 2 points more of attack, defense, and initiative as well as 5 HP more than normal Poketes. Their names are highlighted yellow.

![shiny](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss24.png)

## Poketedex
The Poketedex is made for the player to keep track of all Poketes they have ever caught, along with their stats. It does not list individual Poketes, but instead the Pokete 'race' itself. Poketes you haven't caught yet are shown as a "???".

The Poketedex can be accessed by pressing `5` in the main game.

![dex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss25.png)

## Learning Attacks
For every fifth time a Pokete levels up, it will try to learn a new attack. If the Pokete already has the maximum amount of attacks (4), the player will be prompted to choose an attack to be replaced with the new one. If the amount of attacks is under 4, the new attack will just be added to the existing attacks.

![learning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss26.png)

![learning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxgr-linux/pokete/master/assets/ss/ss27.png)

## Learning Discs
Learning Discs are DVD-like items you can find on the map which can be used to teach a special attack to a Pokete. They can only be used once!
